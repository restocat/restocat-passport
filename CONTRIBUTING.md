## Code Style
restocat-passport uses [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) for checking the code style.
You should run it using `npm lint` before committing to the repo. If you need
to fix indentations automatically then use `npm lint-fix`.

## Submit a PR
* PR should be submitted from a separate branch (use `git checkout -b "fix-123"`) to a `develop` branch
* PR should not decrease the code coverage more than by 1%
* PR's commit message should use present tense and be capitalized properly (i.e., `Fix #123: Add tests for RequestRouter.`)
